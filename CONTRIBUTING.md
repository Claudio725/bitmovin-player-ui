Pull Requests
-------------

This project applies the GitFlow branching model. Please submit bugfix pull requests against the `master` branch if they concern the current release, else against the `develop` branch. Feature branches always go against the `develop` branch. 

Before creating a pull request, please
 * make sure all guidelines are followed
 * add an appropriate entry to the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)
 * make sure that `gulp lint` is free of warnings and errors
 * make sure your branch is free of merge conflicts
